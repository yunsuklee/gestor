# Gestor 🧑‍💼

Gestor is a web-based platform used to manage and share stressful formalities and procedures, making them easier, more intuitive and faster. 

It will:
  - Handle documents by enforcing a naming convention to facilitate their tracking, update and organization.
  - Store all documents, allowing their access in any device and security backups. 
  - Allow users create and share popular procedures with a to-do list schema for adding the necessary documentation, auto-completing and recommending our latest files. 
  - Allow users to download any completed procedure into a ready to share .zip folder or send it directly into the printer! 
  - Suggest deleting repeated or deprecated documents to keep a clean, up-to-date and ready-to-use database.
